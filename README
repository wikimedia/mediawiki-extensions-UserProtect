This extension provides per-page per-user access control.

== Requirements ==

This version of the extension has been tested with MediaWiki 1.35.

== Installation ==

Add this line to your LocalSettings.php:

    wfLoadExtension( 'UserProtect' );

Run the update script which will automatically create the necessary database tables that this extension needs.

== Usage ==

If you are a member of a group with the 'userprotect' right (sysop has this by default) you can see the 'User protect' tab on content pages.
On the User protect tab there is a form that allows you to add or remove permissions for a list of users.
The list of permissions is configurable by $wgUserProtectRestrictionTypes variable.
"All rights" adds or removes all permissions from the list of permissions, even if the list of permissions is changed later.

== Parameters ==

default value:

$wgUserProtectRestrictionTypes = [
	'edit' => true,
	'move' => true,
	'delete' => true,
];
